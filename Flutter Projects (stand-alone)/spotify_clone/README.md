A project that aims to create a working clone of a now-outdated version of the official Spotify (Android) Mobile app

* STATE OF PROJECT:
```diff
+ IN PROGRESS
```

> ⚠️**DISCLAIMER**⚠️: This project is only made for educational purposes, and is definitley not meant to replace any existing version of the official app. Furthermore, the data repository used is only a mock-representation meant to show the functionality of the front-end, and was not retrieved using the official Spotify API.


# Reasons for starting this project:
* To learn more about global state management in Flutter
* To polish up on my intermediate-level knowledge on Flutter animations

# Packages Used:
 - firebase_core: ^2.14.0
 - cloud_firestore: ^4.8.1
 - firebase_storage: ^11.2.3
 - encrypt: ^5.0.1
 - provider: ^6.0.5

> Planning to leave some Easter Eggs in the final version of the app (let me have my fun okay?)
