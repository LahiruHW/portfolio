# flappy_bird

A new Flutter project, made with the goal of cloning the once famous mobile game, with a few ✨personal touches✨ added. 

ICYMI: The goal was never to copy a Youtube video, or maintain the lifecycle of the app itself, but to learn as much as I could about simple Flutter animations.

LAST UPDATE:

* State of Project: 
```diff
- INCOMPLETE (TERMINATED)
```
###### (Terminated due to the difficulties of implementation due to the limitations of the approach chosen + personal reasons).

* Where I stopped: Implementing collisions. I might resume that later or stop from here, as I am satisfied with the animations + other visual improvements that I was able to add to the original code.

* Possible Improvements:
    * Resort to using animation controllers for barrier animations.
    * Implement a StreamQueue for generating & destroying barriers with random (and adaptive) heights.
    * With the rest of this approach I've chosen, at my current skill level, I doubt there's much more I can do. I might re-create this project using the Flutter Flame engine sometime in the future (if I do ever get around to learning it).
