# SPOJToolkit-Cases-and-Output-generator
Extract the test cases for a problem and generate the correct output files from a C++ solution file.

To run simply type :
> python main.py **[solutionfile]** **[problemcode]**

where *solutionfile* is a C++ file placed inside the solutions folder and problem code is the unique code for an SPOJ problem, example -> this is the url for the classical knapsack problem : https://www.spoj.com/problems/KNAPSACK/. Here, "KNAPSACK" is the problem code.
Try running
> python main.py knapsackdp KNAPSACK

to check if everything works fine.
