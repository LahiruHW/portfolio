# portfolio
A portfolio of all the coding (among other activities) I have ever done on online platforms!


<font color="red"> 

NOTE: Please disregard any file with file names that have "X"s in front of it (eg: XXX_codefile.py), as they are failed iterations of the same tasks done (a few months) before they were pushed to this repo. I have no intention of filtering them out to only show the "good" side of my skills (if I have any lol). No one is perfect, and I am only human. <3
