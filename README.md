# Welcome To My Portfolio
This is a portfolio of all the coding (among other activities) I have ever done, on online platforms and/or otherwise!

## NOTE:

Please disregard any file with names that have "X"s in front of them (eg: `XXX_codefile.py`), as they are failed iterations of the same tasks, done (a few months) before they were initially pushed to this repo. I have no intention of filtering them out to only show the "good" side of my skills [>ðŸ™‚<][3]. 
 
No one is perfect, and I am only [human][1]. <3
